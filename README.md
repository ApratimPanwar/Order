This research explores order as a fundamental principle of design through the development of a comprehensive algorithmic framework for analyzing and synthesizing visual compositions. 
The study presents the Design Order Analysis & Synthesis Algorithm (DOASA), which quantitatively evaluates design order across six key dimensions: 
hierarchy, grouping, structural consistency, flow and movement, spatial organization, and variety-harmony balance. 

The research methodology encompasses three primary phases:
(1) theoretical conceptualization of order based on established design principles and Gestalt psychology, 
(2) development of computational algorithms for order detection and optimization, 
(3) implementation of an interactive web application for real-time composition analysis and synthesis. 

Using geometric primitives (circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles)
The study compares aesthetically-pleasing compositions generated through intuitive design with algorithmically-optimized compositions, revealing that mathematical discipline significantly enhances perceptual order. 
The resulting interactive tool, "Order Composer," provides eleven algorithmic modes for automated arrangement and manual controls for fine-tuning, enabling designers to understand and apply order principles systematically.
This research contributes to design education by bridging the gap between subjective aesthetic judgment and objective, measurable design quality, offering a replicable framework for evaluating and improving visual order in any composition.
